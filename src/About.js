        Hi, I'm Andrew. I love creating web experiences that are beautiful, functional and reliable.

      <p>
        Since a young age, I've always had a love for languages. This passion led me to pursue degrees in Linguistics and French & Francophone Studies at the University of Florida and eventually teach English as a second language at 'Portail Rouge', a French middle school in the city of Saint-Etienne.
