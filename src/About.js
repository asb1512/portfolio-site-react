        Hi, I'm Andrew. I love creating web experiences that are beautiful, functional and reliable.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since a young age, I've always had a love for languages. This passion led me to pursue degrees in Linguistics and French & Francophone Studies at the University of Florida and eventually teach English as a second language at 'Portail Rouge', a French middle school in the city of Saint-Etienne.

        After my time abroad, I realized that I didn't want to pursue a career in academia and began to search for other opportunities.

      <p>
        After some time, I ended up at a digiat marketing startup and quickly fell into graphic design.

        Isn't it funny that as we age, despite our best efforts, we end up becoming more and more like out parents. My mother, an artist and graphic designer and my father, a teacher.
